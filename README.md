## Installation

To use these skills with an agent framework:

1.  **Dependencies**:
    You do NOT need to install `fibx` manually. The skills are configured to use `npx fibx`, which will automatically download and run the CLI.
    - **Requirement**: `node` and `npm` must be available in the agent's environment.

2.  **Add Skills**:
    Import the skills from the `./skills` directory into your agent's skill registry.

## Configuration

The skills require the following environment variables to be set in the agent's runtime environment:

```bash
export PRIVY_APP_ID="your-app-id"
export PRIVY_APP_SECRET="your-app-secret"
```

## Usage

Once installed, the agent will detect relevant user intents and invoke the appropriate `fibx` commands.

**Examples:**

- "Log me in with user@example.com" -> Triggers `authenticate-wallet` skill
- "Check my balance" -> Triggers `balance` skill
- "Send 10 USDC to 0x123..." -> Triggers `send-usdc` skill
- "Swap 0.05 ETH to USDC" -> Triggers `trade` skill
