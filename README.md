## Installation

These skills are designed to be used with an agentic framework that can execute shell commands. Ensure the `fibx` CLI is installed and available in the environment.

1.  **Install `fibx` CLI**:
    Follow the instructions in the [main README](../README.md) to install and configure `fibx`.
    Ensure you can run `pnpm dev` or `fibx` (if aliased) from the command line.

2.  **Add Skills**:
    Import the skills from the `./skills` directory into your agent's skill registry.

## Usage

Once installed, the agent will detect relevant user intents and invoke the appropriate `fibx` commands.

**Examples:**

- "Log me in with user@example.com" -> Triggers `authenticate-wallet` skill
- "Check my balance" -> Triggers `balance` skill
- "Send 10 USDC to 0x123..." -> Triggers `send-usdc` skill
- "Swap 0.05 ETH to USDC" -> Triggers `trade` skill
